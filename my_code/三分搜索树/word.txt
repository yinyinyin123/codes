I 
have the bad habit of skipping to the last pages of a book to see how it ends while Im
am still in the middle of it. This habit annoyed first my Mom, then my friends, and
 finally even my own daughter
One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my class walking home 
from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like he was carrying all of his books.
I thought to myself, Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must 
really be a nerd. I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with
myfriend tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on. As I was walking,
 I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They ran at him, knocking all his books outof
 his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw
 them land in the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible 
sadness in his eyes. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his 
glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives.
